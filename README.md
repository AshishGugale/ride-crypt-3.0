# RideCrypt

## Description:

Decentralized applications (dApps) are revolutionizing the ride-sharing industry, challenging traditional platforms with the potential for lower costs and fairer profit distribution for drivers and users. This project aims to tackle current limitations like opaque pricing structures and high commissions by exploring the integration of dApps with geofencing technology. Geofencing leverages GPS or RFID to create virtual boundaries ("geofences") around designated locations.

This repository contains a decentralized ride sharing system that employs geofencing to create geofences around drop-off points. Upon crossing these geofences, predefined actions encoded within smart contracts automatically trigger, facilitating secure and seamless transactions. This integration strengthens the trustless nature of dApps, fostering a more secure and efficient ride-sharing experience.
